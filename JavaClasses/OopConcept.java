    /*
     *  OOP is faster and easier to execute
        OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
        OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
        OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
        Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the 
        codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

     /*
      * Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.

        A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
