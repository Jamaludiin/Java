// By now, you are quite familiar with the public keyword that appears in almost all of our examples:
// The public keyword is an access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the access level for classes, attributes, methods and constructors.

/*
 *  We divide modifiers into two groups:
        Access Modifiers - controls the access level
        Non-Access Modifiers - do not control access level, but provides other functionality
 */

 // For classes, you can use either public or default:

    public	The class is accessible by any other class	
    
    default	The class is only accessible by classes in the same package. 
        This is used when you don't specify a modifier. You will learn more about packages in the Packages chapter */



// For attributes, methods and constructors, you can use the one of the following:
/*
public	The code is accessible for all classes	
private	The code is only accessible within the declared class	
default	The code is only accessible in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier. You will learn more about packages in the Packages chapter	
protected	The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses. You will learn more about subclasses and superclasses in the Inheritance chapter */
