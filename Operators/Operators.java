        Java divides the operators into the following groups:

        Arithmetic operators
            Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

        Assignment operators
            Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
            addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:
            etc

        Comparison operators
            Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). 
            This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.
            The return value of a comparison is either true or false. 
            These values are known as Boolean values, and you will learn more about them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.
        
        Logical operators
            You can also test for true or false values with logical operators.
            Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:
            
        Bitwise operators
